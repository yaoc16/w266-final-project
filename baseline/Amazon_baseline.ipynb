So that everything will fit with no hassles.  So you don\\'t have to reverse engineer the connector.  So you won\\'t have to be cutting and stripping cable, and crimping on connectors. To save time.\\n\\nSo I ordered this cord at the same time as the Escort 9500ix, and a visor bracket.  Overnight, so it would arrive the day before a big road trip.\\n\\nI arrived home after work to the smiley Amazon box.  Everything was there, and the shipping was overnight as promised. (In fact, it was there at 8:45 the next morning.)  I had already researched where to tap into the car\\'s electrical system so started in right away.  Closed the supplied insulation displacement splice onto the correct wire (purple with white stripe, in this case) and fed the wire through to where it needed to pop out of the trim.  Secured the ground screw.  And went to put the 1/4\" bladed fastener onto the blue splice connector.  Except that it wasn\\'t a 1/4\" bladed fastener.  It was much smaller.  It would make contact (if I peeled back the also too-small clear jacket) but it would not stay.  So, off to Radio Shack for some 1/4\" male bladed and insulated crimp-on Fast-ons (the part that mates by design with the splice connector and should have been on the end of that cable).\\n\\nBut that is why I paid $15 for a $0.20 MOD4 connector, $0.20 worth of 4-con POTS cable, a $0.50 inline fuse holder with fuse, and two $0.05 cent crimp-on connectors.  So I would not be spending the night before my trip running out to an electronic supply store, buying cable and connectors, cutting wire and crimping on connectors.  But that is just what I ended up doing BECAUSE ESCORT CRIMPED ON THE WRONG FAST-ON FOR THE SUPPLIED WIRE TAP and it would not function the way they supplied it.\\n\\nIf you look at the photo and know what to look for, you can even see it is wrong in the photo.  The proper part is not clear like in the photo - it is translucent blue (these things have been color-coded by size for decades..) and MUCH BIGGER.  They probably saved $0.005 by using this substandard and wrong part.\\n\\nAnd hence, I can only rate this as an EPIC FAIL.\\n\\nBy the way, with the CORRECT bladed Fast-On installed, the harness worked just fine.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":55}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_output.loc[277554]['Text']\n","# ensemble might work"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"5oK8v_BrzM4U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659162660682,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":238,"user":{"displayName":"Grace Li","userId":"15968155280806994807"}},"outputId":"1777f684-d498-412a-ba67-c0fa066cf875"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Great sound and great features.

I found that VR on this camera didn't seem to help much at all if there is much movement in the subject. I also was not able to get pictures of my kids at a birthday party that are acceptable - there is some level of blurriness in almost all of the shots.\\n\\nI thought I was having some success with the sports mode (those pics looked Ok on the LCD), but once transferred to the PC, they were unacceptable, even though I used the highest resolution available. I see that Nikon even suggests a different camera for people wanting good indoor or low light photo capability in their recent advertising, so even they don't recommend this model for indoor pics.\\n\\nSo this camera seems good for outdoors with lots of light, when taking photos of stationary objects or landscapes. But things with movement just aren't working out for me. I returned it since my previous Panasonic SZ7 outperforms this L120 (I was also A/B'ing the two).\\n\\nI was also not happy with the clarity of the pictures - they seem a bit off even on stationary objects with lots of light, almost like the autofocus does not work really well. After reading other reviews, it seems that others are also having problems with blurriness indoors or with pictures of people too, so I guess I'm not alone on this.\\n\\nAlso note that it is possible that my L120 was defective - I just can't believe so many people are giving such good ratings for the most part based on the types of pictures mine gave before I returned it.
